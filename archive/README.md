   <h1>Map Dashboard Web Application</h1>
   <p>
      This repository houses the source code for the Map Dashboard data visualization web application project. It uses
      <a href="https://vuejs.org/"><strong>Vue 3</strong></a>
      and
      <a href="https://vuetifyjs.com/en/"><strong>Vuetify</strong></a>.
   </p>

## Recommended IDE Setup

We **highly** recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for its great plugins. The project is also setup for auto-linting with VSCode on file save! You'll need at least the [Vue - Official](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) plugin. Once you open the source code in VSCode, some other convenient plugins should also be recommended to you.

# Features & Implementation Details

## Important Links

This project currently uses Tableau to format geospatial input data. Tableau has an extensive library of [tutorials](https://www.tableau.com/resources) and [API documentation](https://www.tableau.com/developer/tools?category=19921).

## Features

The Map Dashboard will display 3 types of map data:

1. Base map using our data from Notion
2. Water department polygons showing water volume (gradient of blue shades)
3. Canopy density (using transparency layer or classified zones; gradient of green shades)

There are 2 types of map marker pins; pins can be grouped or clustered:

1. Plants: green pins
2. Animals: red pins

Users can hover over marker pins and map data to view a tooltip that displays any of the following information:

1. Name of the animal or plant
2. Water volume
3. Canopy cover

Users can filter the map by:

- Animal vs plant
- Water volume
- Canopy density
